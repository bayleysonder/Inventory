Languages used: html, css, javascript, jquery, php, and MySQL
- *Currently working on a getting a live version of this application online.

This application helps an organization track their assets. 

Application logic 
Employee's can access inventory tracking system by creating an account on the website. It will do a cross check to see if this user already has a employee account, if so it will update the employee table with the userid that they just created. 

These accounts are now paired if the user does not have elevated access they will only be able to link their account and to look at the inventory and assets checked out. For elevated users this application is front end application that makes changes to myphpadmin database. This is used for the IT departement to help keep track of Laptops, desktops, All-in-one systems, Monitors, docks, and iPads.
